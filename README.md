Do we have a clear understanding of the problem?

Problem: Difficult and tedious to create an itinerary while traveling, it takes an excessive amount of time and effort

Traditionally, this is done through research or travel agencies, where the latter costs a decent amount. If we can create an application that can suggest points of interest based on user preferences, a streamlined process can be made that can assist users with no cost of time or money. 

This would be primarily targeted towards people traveling in foreign areas, where they may not know about particular regions. The app can suggest places based on user preferences and budget. Suggestions will be based on Google Maps ratings as well as ChatGPT. Thus, APIs for both will be used.

This project has one main feature consisting of giving the user an AI-generated itinerary for an area based on the user's interests and likes. Other features would include being able to set the distance the person is willing to travel, budget, and being able to add and remove interests that the user would want to have events/activities recommended for.

As far as the scope of the project goes, we aim to include at least several areas that are common destination spots. 

Some areas to aim for are: 
East Asia
West Europe
North America

Example user story:
Tom is a backpacker based in Canada and wants to travel to Japan. However, he is very busy beforehand and finds it difficult to find the time to plan out which areas he wants to go to, and is unsure of the local area. He doesn’t have the time to go through multiple sites to comb for points of interest. Using this app can save him essential time.
